`MarkDown` generator for `.js` and `.ts` source files with `js-doc` documentation blocks 

## Why?
I was looking for an out of the box, simple setup document generator for a project of mine.
So I could easily generate my documentation for this project. 
It was harder than it sounded, to hard.

### These where my demands
1. Runs right away after installation without extra setup.
2. Supports typescript and javascript.
3. Supports js-docs.
4. Generates MarkDown files.
5. Has as little dependencies as possible.
6. Is fast
7. Is a node application

Turns out that it didn't exist, or I could not find it.
That's why I created this package, hope it helps you as much as it helped me

## Installation
```shell
npm install mark-down-my-docs 
```

## Usage
Run command with source directory and docs directory.

```shell
mark-down-my-docs src/ docs/
```

## Support
supports `.js` and `.ts` files with `js-doc` blocks

runs on node *16.13.1
